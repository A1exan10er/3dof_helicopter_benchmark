# 3dof_helicopter_benchmark

## How to run the model
In order to run the Simulink/Simscape© implementation of the model and the controller proposed in the paper, simply run the `helico_main.m` script. It both loads the simulation parameters and runs the the `helico_model.slx` Simulink© model.
The model has been developed in Matlab version R2017a.
